            The chameleon is an arboreal species, that is to say living in
            trees, which feeds mainly on insects. To capture its prey, the
            chameleon uses its tongue to bring the insects back to its mouth for
            food. It's from that tongue that we were inspired to design our
            product. Indeed, it's a really interesting organ.

            Chameleons are known to propel their tongues with high speed and
            great power. This speed and power is due to an accelerating muscle
            and a complex mechanism. The tongue of this animal can be projected
            at a force that can reach more than 250 times that due to
            gravitation.

            Composed of many muscles, the tongue is stored in the mouth on a
            bone. The animal projects its tongue with great precision, the end
            of which is covered with sticky mucus, on its prey.

      <h2>An innovative Product</h2>
      <h3>High technology in your hands</h3>
      <p>
        The pistol-tongue is the latest jewel of engineering, its conception
        made on a highly new tech and physics concept to offer the best
        faculties between pros and cons of a real chameleon tongue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, the real challenge here was to obtain a sustainment elastic,
        robust and fast the tongue to reach the 20km/h. The material used are
        specific polymer. The glue is the strongest glue that men has ever
        created. It can lift almost 1 thousand pounds. There is 5 small engines
        located in the haft. The pistol-tongue integrate a high-end artificial
        intelligence powered by a huge cpu 100% chance to hit for any insect you
        want to catch.
